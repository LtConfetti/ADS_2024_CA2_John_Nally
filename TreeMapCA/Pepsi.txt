BREATHTAKING Design Strategy 2008.08.04 ARNELL GROUP WORK IN PROGRESS 2008.08.04 A. BREAKING THE CODE FOR INNOVATION From Convention to Innovation BREATHTAKING Trajectory of Innovation CONVENTION DNA INNOVATION FUTURE D. Continued investment provides us with a clear resource for reinvention. CONVENTION DNA INNOVATION FUTURE C. The investment in our DNA leads to breakthrough innovation and allows us to move out of the traditional linear system and into the future. CONVENTION DNA INNOVATION B. By investing in our history and brand ethos we can create a new trajectory forward. A. How do we move from convention to innovation? CONVENTION INNOVATION B. THE ORIGINS OF CREATIVE ENDEAVORS Universal Design Principles and PepsiCo’s Brand Heritage BREATHTAKING Brand Heritage and the Aesthetics of Simplicity The Pepsi ethos has evolved over time. The vocabulary of truth and simplicity is a reoccurring phenomena in the brand’s history. It communicates the brand in a timeless manner and with an expression of clarity. Pepsi BREATHTAKING builds on this knowledge. True innovation always begins by investigating the historic path. Going back-to-the-roots moves the brand forward as it changes the trajectory of the future. 1910 1970 2009 BREATHTAKING Universal Design Principles BREATHTAKING is a strategy based on the evolution of 5000+ years of shared ideas in design philosophy creating an authentic Constitution of Design. This chart documents the origin and evolution of intellectual property. 600 BC Musica Mundana: Pythagoras creates spatial hierarchies from musical scales 300 BC Golden Ratio: Euclid explores the mathematics and proportion of nature 278 BC Feng Shui: Ancient Chinese art of placement and spatial arrangement 1452 The Art of Building: Alberti draws on the relation of numbers and areas 70 BC Vitruvian Principle: In “De Architectura” he demands: strong, useful, beautiful. 1455 Vitruvian Renaissance: Rediscovery of the Vitruvian principles and their publication 1637 La Géométrie: Descartes develops the cartesian coordinate system 1858 Möbius Strip: Möbius creates a surface with only one side and edge 1948 The Modulor: Le Corbusier draws algebraic relations in the human body Natural Sunflower Grid City Grid Dome Grid Euclidian Geometry Proportions of a Circle Sub-Proportions Natural Golden Spiral Parthenon Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa Natural Magnetic Energy Duality in Balance Elements of Energy “De Architectura” Greek House Plan Long: 1:1, 2:3, 3:4 Middle: 2:4, 4:9, 9:16 Short: 1:1, 2:3, 3:4 Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man Vitruvian Sphere Vitruvian Theater “De La Method” Proportional Compass Möbius Strip Construction of the Strip The Modulor Hand Proportion Head Rotation House Grid 3000 BC Vāstu Śāstra: Hindu Tradition of numerical harmony as spatial organizer Geometric Golden Mean Vitruvian Analemma 2009 Pepsi: Pepsi introduces Breathtaking BREATHTAKING Iconic Geometry Derived from PepsiCo’s rich packaging legacy and inspired by some of its earliest forms and proportions, BREATHTAKING revitalizes the essence of PepsiCo in creating an iconic shape for the brand. 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 1898 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1898-2009 Retain the best of PepsiCo’s history and shape the next PepsiCo bottle into an icon for the brand. BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1898 1896 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations The Pepsi DNA finds its origin in the dynamic of perimeter oscillations. This new identity manifests itself in an authentic geometry that is to become proprietary to the Pepsi culture. 1905 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1905 1906 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1906 1929 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1929 1930 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1930 1962 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1962 1971 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1971 14° 1991 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1991 1998 Pepsi Geometries: Perimeter Oscillations BREATHTAKING Tracing the Pepsi DNA - 1998 C. TOWARDS INNOVATION: PROJECTING PEPSI’S FUTURE Applying Universal Laws to Establish a Blueprint for the Brand Artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the Golden Ratio, especially in the form of the Golden Rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the Golden Ratio. They believe this proportion to be universally and aesthetically pleasing. The Golden Ratio plays an essential role in human perception of beauty. BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: Precedents The diameter of the Nautilus Shell increases proportionally with the Golden Ration. Leonardo Da Vinci studied the proportion of the human face and applied his findings in the Mona Lisa painting. Height and width of the Parthenon is proportioned to yield a Golden Rectangle. Book format and page layout are based on the Golden Proportion. BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: A Blueprint for Proportions A. The Golden Ratio It starts with a square. B. The Pepsi Ratio It starts with a circle. a=1.61803399 b=1 a=1.61803399 b=1 a a a 0.5a b a a a 0.5a a a=1.61803399 b=1 a a=1.61803399 b=1 7. The Pepsi Ratio is created by two simple circles, that are in a set ratio to each other: The Golden Ratio. 0.5b 0.5a 8. The Pepsi Ratio is aesthetic geometry. a 1. Draw a circle with diameter d=a. 0.5a 0.5a 4. Draw a circle that lies within the larger one. Its diameter is such that it touches all three circles in exactly and only in one point. 0.5a 0.5a 2. Find its center and draw two same size circles with diameter d=0.5a. 0.5a 45° 0.5a 0.5a 3. Rotate the centerline 45°. Copy one of the smaller circles. Place its center on the intersection of the larger circle and the rotated centerline. a b 56° 5. Rotate the centerline by 56°. Place the smallest circle with its center on the intersection of the largest circle and the rotated centerline. 6. The Pepsi brand is created by intersecting circles with a set proportion to each other. The coordinates are marked (x). 0.5b a b 0.5a A. Geometry of Aesthetics: Proportion The Golden Ratio establishes a proportion of one part (a) relative to another (b). Playing by these rules produces an aesteticism that is universally accepted to be in balance and harmony. The Pepsi aesthetic respects these rules: The brand identity can be derived from two circles, that have a set relation to each other. BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: Scales and Dynamic Relationships B. Geometry of Aesthetics: Dynamics b c d D 45° C b c a A d 36° b a a b a = a b = b BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: Dynamic Forces A. The Earth’s Geodynamo A naturally occurring electric generator in fluid motion generates and sustains the Earth’s magnetic field. A. The Pepsi Globe B. Magnetic Fields Magnetic fields exert forces on inner and outer surfaces of the Earth. B. Pepsi Energy Fields Symmetrical energy fields are in balance. S N S N C. Magnetic Dynamics Magnetic field are impacted by sun radiation and wind motion. C. The Pepsi Globe Dynamics Emotive forces shape the gestalt of the brand identity. 2008 2010 BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: Multiple Perspectives Multiple point of views, One Object 15˚ 30˚ 45˚ 60˚ 75˚ 90˚ 70˚ 55˚ 40˚ 25˚ 10˚ One Identity, Multiple Emotions 0˚ BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: The Face of a New Generation BREATHTAKING Creation of Identity: A Multi-Dimensionalized Brand A.
